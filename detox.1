.Sh NAME
.Nm detox
.Nd clean up filenames
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl hrv
.Op Fl -dry-run
.Op Fl -remove-trailing
.Op Fl -special
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility renames files to make them easier to work with.  It removes
spaces and other non-friendly characters.  It'll also translate or
cleanup Latin-1 (ISO8859.1) characters.
.Pp
The main options:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl h -help
Display helpful information.
.It Fl r
Recurse into subdirectories.
.It Fl v
Be verbose about which files are being renamed.
.El
.Pp
Some extra functionality:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl -dry-run
Doesn't actually change anything.  This implies the
.Fl v
option.
.It Fl -remove-trailing
Removes _ and - after .'s in filenames.
.It Fl -special
Works on special files (including links).  Normally detox ignores
these files.
.El
.Sh NOTES
.Nm 
was originally designed to clean up files that I had received from
friends which had been created using other operating systems.  It's
trivial to create a filename with spaces, parenthesis, brackets, and
ampersands under other operating systems.  These have special meaning
under other operating systems.  I created detox to clean up these
files.
.Sh BUGS
Please report any bugs.
