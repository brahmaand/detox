.Sh NAME
.Nm detoxrc
.Nd configuration file for
.Xr detox 1
.Sh OVERVIEW
detox allows for configuration of its sequences through config files.
This document describes how these files work.
.Sh SYNTAX
The format of this configuration file is C-like.  It is based loosely
off named's configuration files.  Each statement is semicolon
terminated, and modifiers on a particular statement are generally
contained within braces.
.Bl -tag -width 0.25i
.It Cm sequence Qo Ar name Qc Bro Ar ... Brc ;
Defines a sequence of filters to run a filename through.  "name"
specifies how the user will refer to the particular sequence during
runtime.  Quotes around the sequence name are generally optional, but
should be used if the sequence name does not start with a letter.
.Pp
There is a special sequence, named "default", which is the default
sequence used by detox.  This can be overridden through the command
line option -s or the environmental variable 
.Ev DETOX_SEQUENCE .
.Pp
Sequence names are case sensitive and unique throughout all sequences;
that is, if a system wide file defines
.Ar normal_seq
and a user has a sequence with the same name in their 
.Pa .detoxrc , 
the users' 
.Ar normal_seq
will take precedence.
.It Cm iso8859_1 Bro Cm filename Qo Ar /path/to/filename Qc ; Brc ;
This translates ISO 8859-1 (aka Latin-1) characters into lower ASCII
equivalents.  The output is not necessarily safe, and should also be
run through the
.Cm safe
filter.
.Pp
Under normal circumstances, the filename syntax is not needed.  Detox
looks in several locations for a file called 
.Pa iso8859_1.tbl , 
which is a set of rules defining how an ISO 8859-1 character should be
translated.
.Pp
In the event this table doesn't exist, you have two options.  You can
download or create your own, and tell detox the location of it using
the filename syntax shown above, or you can let detox fall back on its
internal tables.  The internal tables translate the same as the stock
translation tables.
.Pp
You can chain together multiple iso8859_1 translations, as long as the
default value of all but the last one is set to nothing.  This is
explained in
.Xr detox.tbl 5 .
.Pp
This filter is mutually exclusive with the
.Cm utf_8
filter.
.It Cm utf_8 Bro Cm filename Qo Ar /path/to/filename Qc ; Brc ;
This translates Unicode characters, encoded by the UTF-8 translation
method, into safe equivalents.
.Pp
This operates in a manner similar to 
.Cm iso8859_1 , 
except it looks for a translation table called 
.Pa unicode.tbl .
.Pp
The default internal translation for Unicode characters only contains
the lower 256 characters of Unicode, which is equivalent to the set of
Basic Latin and Latin-1 characters.
.It Cm uncgi ;
This translates CGI escaped strings into their ASCII equivalents. The
output of this is not necessarily safe, and could contain ISO 8859-1
chars or potentially UTF-8 characters.
.It Cm safe ;
This could also be called "safe for UNIX-like operating systems".  It
translates the following characters into their safe equivalents.
.Pp
See the
.Sx SAFE
section for more details on what this filter translates.
.It Cm wipeup Bro Cm remove_trailing ; Brc ;
This wipes up any excessive characters.  For instance, multiple
underscores or dashes will be converted into a single underscore or
dash.  Any series of dash and underscore (i.e. "_-_") will be
converted into a single dash.
.Pp
The remove trailing option removes a dash or underscore followed
immediately by a period.
.It Cm max_length Bro Cm length Ar value ; Brc ;
This trims a file down to the length specified (or less).  It is
conscious of extensions and attempts to preserve anything following
the last period in a filename.
.Pp
For instance, given a max length of 12, and a filename of
"this_is_my_file.txt", the filter would output "this_is_.txt".
.It Cm # Comments
Any thing after a # on any line is ignored.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLE
.Bd -literal
sequence default {
  uncgi;
  iso8859_1 {
    filename "iso8859_1.tbl";
  };
# utf_8 {
#   filename "unicode.tbl";
# };
  safe;
  wipeup {
    remove_trailing;
  };
# max_length {
#   length 128;
# };
};
.Ed
.Sh SAFE
The following characters are translated by the
.Cm safe 
filter.
.Pp
.Ss Rules that apply anywhere in the filename:
.Bl -column -offset indent ".Sy Removed" ".Sy Original"
.It Sy Safe Ta Sy Original
.It _and_ Ta &
.It _ Ta \fIspace\fR ` \&! @ $ * \e | \&: \&; \&" ' < > \&? / 
.It - Ta \&( \&) \&[ \&] { }
.El
.Pp
.Ss Rules that apply only at the beginning of a filename:
Any leading dashes are stripped to prevent programs from interpreting
these files as command line options.
.Bl -column -offset indent ".Sy Removed" ".Sy Original"
.It Sy Safe Ta Sy Original
.It \fIremoved\fR Ta -
.It _ Ta # \&( \&) \&[ \&] { }
