detox is a program that renames files to make them easier to work with
under Unix and related operating systems.  Spaces and various other unsafe
characters (such as "$") get replaced with "_".  ISO8859.1 (Latin-1)
characters will be replaced as well, as intelligently as possible (for
instance, "A" with an umlaut gets replaced with "A").

This is a BETA release.  Please watch for falling bits.

Compilation:
	./configure
	make

Installation:
	make install

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The simplest way to run detox is to just run it on a directory containing
files that need work:
	detox xfer_files/

You can also just to specify the filename:
	detox my\ bad\ file.txt

You can also specify recursion (this works best on directories):
	detox -r /music/transfered_from_elsewhere/

Notes:
	This project was initially developed under Linux (RedHat 7.x, 8.x),
	and is presently being maintained under FreeBSD 5.1.  If you run
	into any problems with installation or operation please feel free
	to contact me.

	complete list of Latin-1 translations.
