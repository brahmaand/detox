detox is a program that renames files to make them easier to work with
under Unix and related operating systems.  Spaces and various other unsafe
characters (such as "$") get replaced with "_".  ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1)
characters can be replaced as well, as can UTF-8 characters.  More details
are contained in the detox.1 man page.

This is a BETA release.  Please watch for falling bits.

Compilation:
	./configure
	make

Installation:
	make install


Notes on Compilation:

Ensure that the path to lex/yacc (or an equivalent) is in your $PATH
environmental variable.  For instance, under Solaris, you may need to add
/usr/ccs/bin to your path to get detox to compile.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The most important option to learn is -n, aka --dry-run.  This will let you
run detox without actually changing any files, so that you can get an idea
of what detox is all about.

The simplest way to run detox is to just run it on a directory containing
files that need work:
	detox xfer_files/

You can also just to specify the filename:
	detox my\ bad\ file.txt

You can also specify recursion (this works best on directories):
	detox -r /music/transfered_from_elsewhere/
